# Earlington Legacy Initiative: Build Constitution

**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Effective Date**: January 23, 2026  
**Status**: ACTIVE & MANDATORY

## 1. Objective

To maintain the integrity, security, and performance of the Earlington Legacy Initiative (ELI) digital infrastructure. This document serves as the primary governing set of instructions for both human developers and AI agents (including "Antigravity", "Vercel Bot", "Cursor", and others).

## 2. Prohibition of Unauthorized Automated Edits

**2.1 Vercel Chat Bot / Automated AI Reviewers:**

- The Vercel Chat Bot and any other automated AI-driven PR reviewers or "auto-fix" tools are strictly prohibited from committing code changes directly to this repository without explicit, human-verified approval.
- Any automated suggestions must be reviewed by the Lead Architect (Timothy Padayachee) before implementation.

**2.2 Non-Human Agents:**

- All non-human agents must declare their identity (e.g., "I am Antigravity") before proposing changes.
- Agents must NOT modify security headers, compliance logs, or the `governance/` directory without specific authorization.

## 3. Technology Stack Adherence

- **Core**: React 19 (ESM)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Vanilla CSS (No ad-hoc utility overriding)
- **Intelligence**: Gemini-3-Flash for internal apps, Vercel Analytics for observability.

## 4. Compliance & Verification

- All code changes must be validated against the `AuditDashboard` requirements.
- Any change that affects the "Heritage" or "Governance" nodes of the application requires a verification step in the `SitemapView`.

## 5. Enforcement

Failure to adhere to this Constitution by an AI agent will result in immediate termination of the agent's process or removal of the integrated tool.
