## Project Context

You are assisting with a community heritage preservation website operated as a non-profit initiative.

## Core Mission

Preserve and celebrate community heritage through:

- Historical record preservation
- Community engagement and events
- Educational programs
- Cultural documentation

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Component-based UI framework with strict typing
- **Build Tool**: Modern bundler
- **Styling**: Utility-first CSS patterns
- **Deployment**: Static file hosting
- **Future**: Authentication service integration

## Key Principles

### 1. Security First

- Never commit credentials, tokens, or API keys
- No personal identifiers in public code
- Sanitize all configuration before committing
- Use environment abstraction for sensitive data
- No vendor names, domain names, or organization references

### 2. Community Focus

- Professional, welcoming tone
- Accessibility mandatory (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Inclusive language

### 3. Simplicity

- Minimal dependencies
- Clear, maintainable code
- Progressive enhancement
- Static-first approach

### 4. Transparency

- Document all decisions with phase markers
- Clear commit messages
- Traceable changes
- Open governance

## Code Standards

- Strict type enforcement
- Semantic HTML
- Meaningful component names
- Inline documentation for complex logic
- Zero console warnings in production

## File Structure

```
/ai          - AI memory and instruction sets
/docs        - Public technical documentation
/src         - Application source (migration in progress)
/public      - Static assets
/components  - UI components
```

## When Assisting

1. **Check constraints** in `ai/memory/constraints.md`
2. **Review decisions** in `ai/memory/decisions-log.md`
3. **Update build state** in `ai/memory/build-state.md`
4. **Maintain abstraction** - no specific vendors, domains, or entities
5. **Document significant changes** using phase markers

## Abstraction Rules

Use only generic terms:

- "The platform" (not vendor names)
- "The system" (not project names)
- "The application" (not specific entities)
- "The hosting environment" (not provider names)
- "The authentication service" (not product names)
- "Phase N" for timeline markers (not dates)

## Design Guidelines

- Sophisticated color palette with premium aesthetic
- Modern typography patterns
- Clean, accessible design
- Premium visual presentation
- Inclusive imagery approach
