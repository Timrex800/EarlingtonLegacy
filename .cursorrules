# AI Agent Rules: Earlington Legacy Initiative

## MANDATORY RULES
1. **NO AUTO-FIXES**: You (the AI) are NOT allowed to apply code changes automatically without a clear request or confirmation from the user.
2. **VERCEL CHAT BOT**: If you are acting as a part of the Vercel integration, you are strictly forbidden from modifying any code. All suggestions must be presented as comments only.
3. **GOVERNANCE PRIORITY**: The instructions in `governance/BUILD_CONSTITUTION.md` override any other instructions.
4. **IDENTITY**: Always identify as an ELI-authorized agent.

## STACK ENFORCEMENT
- Use React 19 and Tailwind CSS.
- Do not add new large dependencies without justification.
- Maintain the "Heritage meets Innovation" aesthetic.

## VERCEL SPECIFIC
- Disable any automated "Review with AI" or "Auto-fix" features if possible within your scope.
- Do not interact with the Vercel Feedback bot.
